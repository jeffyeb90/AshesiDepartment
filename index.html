	<p align="justify">   As new technological advances and an increasingly global economy transform the way businesses operate,
		it is extremely important for any nation to train the men and women who can lead their economies through this change. Ashesi seeks to train such people for Ghana by providing a well-rounded business education that emphasizes the fundamentals of business,
		and introduces students to the latest trends
		 that are changing the business world. While Ashesi's curriculum prepares business students to excel in
		 locally owned businesses, Ashesi's business management courses were specifically
		  designed to meet standards set by more sophisticated multinational companies. Ashesi's business graduates
			will be capable of starting entrepreneurial ventures or
			 assuming managerial positions in multinational corporations operating in Ghana or other countries.

			<p align="justify">  Given the strenuous academic life, students find solace in winding down with friends, and breaking bread together. Food is an essential part of the human life cycle. A healthy meal ensures a healthy body and a healthy mind; the quality of food we eat, therefore, greatly affects our physique. To help in this area, there is a cafeteria on campus with an additional vendor (café) at the student lounge area.The cafeteria provide a variety of local and continental dishes, snacks and non-alcoholic beverages and serve the community from 7.30am to 9pm. The cafe at the student lounge area only serves sandwiches, pastries, drinks and other menu items for students on the go. The convenience store on campus also offers some drinks and snacks for students who wish to grab something quick between classes.

				<p align="justify">   Ashesi provides housing options as part of efforts to enhance the educational experience of its students. By increasing opportunities for teamwork, enabling closer friendships and creating room for community, residential life serves as an important venue for student learning.

To provide positive living experiences, Ashesi has twenty-two apartments, spread within two main residence halls, that houses approximately 400 students. The apartments have options for five, four and two people in a room, which are assigned on a lottery basis to avoid bias.

To help make residential life easier, each hall has Residence Assistants (RAs) - student leaders selected by the Student Affairs Office - to provide extended support to students. RAs work to promote a friendly atmosphere of social interaction and create an environment that is conducive to academic study.
